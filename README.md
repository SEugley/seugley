## Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
As a Data Scientist with a strong academic and research background in life sciences and experience working on the frontlines of healthcare, I have a natural passion for leveraging health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance the field. 

Note: If I'm not at my laptop, you'll probably find me running on the trails, playing fetch with my dog in the yard, or most likely getting some coffee!
