## Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
As a Data Scientist with a strong academic and research foundation in life sciences, coupled with hands-on experience on the frontlines of healthcare, I naturally have a deep passion for transforming health-related data into meaningful insights that impirove patient outcomes and drive progress in the field of medical technology.

When I’m not diving into data, you’ll likely find me hitting the trails for a run, playing fetch with my dog in the yard, or in pursuit of a good cup of coffee. ☕
