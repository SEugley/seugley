## Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
As a Data Scientist with a strong academic and research background in life sciences and experience working on the frontlines of healthcare, I have a natural passion for leveraging health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance the field of medicine.
