## Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
As a Data Scientist with a strong academic and research background in life sciences and experience working on the frontlines of healthcare, I have a natural passion for leveraging health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance the field. 


When I’m not diving into data, you’ll likely find me hitting the trails for a run, playing fetch with my dog in the yard, or fueling my day with a good cup of coffee!
