## Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
As a Data Scientist with a strong academic and research background in life sciences and experience working on the frontlines of healthcare, I have a natural passion for leveraging health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance the field. 

When I'm not in front of my laptop, you'll find me running on the trails 🏃🏻‍♂️, playing fetch with my dog 🐶, or getting coffee ☕
